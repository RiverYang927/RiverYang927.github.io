Greetings! I‚Äôm Zijiang Yang, currently a first-year Master of Science (MS) student in the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Automation through a joint training program between Southwest University (SWU, China) and the University of Western Australia (UWA), under the supervision of Prof. Wei Huang[[Link]](https://cis.swu.edu.cn/info/1185/4097.htm).

Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) is deeply rooted in signal processing, communications, and control. During my undergraduate studies in Automation, I devoted substantial time to mastering these areas, which has equipped me with a strong background to grow rapidly at Duke.
